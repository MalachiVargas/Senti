// Summarize this dialogue:\nhuman1\nHey there! Saw your message that you're looking for FE dev for the LabLabAI hackaton. I'm intereseted, if you haven't found one yet we should chat!\nhuman2\nHey Kevin! I'm the product manager for my team, we have a proficient python developer and a full-stack react developer. The product is an AI Real Estate Sales Training App. The plan is to train a model to be conversational and provide great tips on persuasion. Are you able to code alongside another dev with Typescript/NextJS/React environment? What is your favorite part about building UIs?\nhuman1\nSadly I'm not going to have availability this weekend, but I'm still interested if you guys are planning to participate in another hackaton or building something else. And I love building UIs to create great experiences for users, I hate frustrating user experiences so that drives me to build things that are a pleasure to use! I recently got laid off from Polymarket and I'm now trying to build my own path in this industry, so it's great to make new connections, and you have the skills I lack! Let's keep in touch, I'd love to know more about your journey\nhuman2\nSorry to hear about the layoffs. I'm currently in the job market too and it's been tough to find the right opportunity I'm excited about. I have saved the project for the OpenAI hackathon in February and would love for you to join me in working on it. The project is a customer relationship management tool, similar to Salesforce, that uses customer context to provide conversational guidance on persuasion and empathy. If you are interested in learning more about this project before committing to the hackathon in February, I would be happy to schedule a call to provide more information.\nSummary: human1 and human 2 are discussing human 2's interest in the FE hackathon that human 2 is considering going to. human 2 mentions that human 1 has saved the project for it. human 2 also mentions that their team is participating in the hackathon and that human 1 would be part of their team as a python developer. human 2 also asks if human 1 is comfortable working in a Typescript / NextJS / React environment.\n
